In this project, We have tried to make a FULL-STACK project by manipulating dom elements using REACT with TypeScript, style using CSS in react, styled-components, and tried to make a responsive website and implement dynamic routing to persist data. We have managed our database globally using MySQL. 

This is a collaborative project built within 2 days by a team of 4 members.
